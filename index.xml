      <description>Abstract Link to heading Real-Time Prediction of Spatiotemporal Dynamics in the Built Environment: An AI and Internet of Things Approach Link to heading Project aim: To develop an AI system for the prediction of spatiotemporal dynamics in the built environment using near real-time geospatial IoT sensor data.&#xA;RO1: Develop tools to assess the quality of near real-time sensor data. RO2: Assess the spatiotemporal dependency of near real-time sensor data. RO3: Assimilate outputs of agent-based models with real-time sensor data to monitor urban systems in real-time.</description>

      <description>Abstract Link to heading This dissertation evaluates Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s urban accessibility within the &amp;lsquo;15-minute city&amp;rsquo; model, aiming to determine how well the city conforms to ideals of proximity, density, and diversity. Utilising GIS data, pedestrian network analysis, and socio-economic assessments, the study categorises Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s amenities and assesses walkability at various urban scales. Findings reveal areas of strength and opportunities for enhancement in Newcastle&amp;rsquo;s urban fabric, suggesting targeted interventions to improve walkability.</description>
