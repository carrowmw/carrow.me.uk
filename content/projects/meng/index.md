# Abstract

This dissertation evaluates Newcastle's urban accessibility within the '15-minute city' model, aiming to determine how well the city conforms to ideals of proximity, density, and diversity. Utilising GIS data, pedestrian network analysis, and socio-economic assessments, the study categorises Newcastle's amenities and assesses walkability at various urban scales. Findings reveal areas of strength and opportunities for enhancement in Newcastle's urban fabric, suggesting targeted interventions to improve walkability. The research contributes to urban planning discussions by offering insights into applying the '15-minute city' concept in Newcastle, highlighting the importance of integrated urban design and policy frameworks to foster sustainable, accessible, and livable cities.
