### Real-Time Prediction of Spatiotemporal Dynamics in the Built Environment: An AI and Internet of Things Approach
The motivation behind this research stems from the complexities and non-linear behaviors of urban systems, which present significant computational modeling challenges. The study aims to transform cities into inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable entities by comprehending urban behavior under various interventions. A critical aspect of this research involves the concept of 'connected digital twins' â€” detailed digital replicas of physical spaces and processes, contributing to product lifecycle management (PLM) and building information modeling (BIM). The project emphasizes the importance of synchronicity and fidelity in these digital twins, acknowledging the complexities in connecting existing asset-level twins with models of human behavior.

The proposal outlines four key objectives. The first objective is to investigate methods for assessing the quality of near real-time sensor data, focusing on its suitability and utility in predicting specific behaviors. This involves devising methodologies for evaluating IoT data quality and applying it to different case studies, like pedestrian sensors in railway stations. The second objective is to develop methods for assessing the spatiotemporal dependency of near real-time sensor data. This will involve an exploratory analysis of data patterns and training of deep learning models for spatio-temporal predictions. The third objective aims to develop methods for simulating complex interactions based on sensor data, utilizing agent-based models (ABMs) and creating efficient surrogate models using deep learning techniques. Finally, the fourth objective is to develop a roadmap for deploying complex systems monitoring using real-world case studies. This includes reviewing the technological readiness levels and addressing challenges related to scalability and generalisability.

Overall, this research seeks to advance the field of urban system analysis by leveraging AI and IoT technologies to create a comprehensive and predictive understanding of the dynamic urban environment. The novel approaches proposed in this study have the potential to significantly enhance decision-making in urban planning and management.
